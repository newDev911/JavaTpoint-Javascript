	<p> We can create external Javascript file and embed it into many
		 HTML pages </p>

	<p> It provides code re-usablity because single Javascript file can
		 be used in several HTML pages </p>

	<p> An external Javascript file must be saved by '.js' extension.
		 It is recommended to embed all Javascript files into one file.
		 It increases the speed of the webpage </p>


	<p>Welcome to Javascript</p>

	<form>
		<!-- Call the function that is defined in external js file -->
		<input type="button" value="Click Me" onclick="msg()">
