<!-- 
	There are two types of Data Types in javascript
	1. Primitive Data Types
	2. Non-Primitive (reference) Data Types
 -->
<!-- 
 	Javascript is a 'dynamic type language'
 	You don't need to specify the type of variable because it is dynamically used
 	by Javascript Engine 

	EXAMPLE:
	var a = 50; // holding number
	var b = "Jane"; // holding string(text)
 -->
<!-- 
 	There are 5 primitive 'Data Types'
 	1. String(Text)
 	2. Number
 	3. Boolean(true or false)
 	4. Undefined
 	5. Null

 	There are 3 non-primitive 'Data Types'
 	1. Object(instance through which we can access members)
 	2. Array(group of similar values)
 	3. RegExp(regular expression)
