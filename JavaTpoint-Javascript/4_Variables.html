<!-- 
	<p> A Javasript variable is simply a name of storage location.</p>
	<p> There are two types of variables: Local Variable & Global Variable</p>

	<p> There are some rules while declaring a variable (also known as identifier) </p>

	<p>
		1. Name must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign. <br>
		2. After first letter we can use numbers. <br>
		3. Javascript variables are case-sensitive, x and X are different Variables. <br>
	</p>

	<p>
		A variable that is inside a function or operation is called 'Local Variable' <br>
		A variable that is outside a function or operation is called 'Global Variable' <br>
	</p>

	<h2> VARIABLE EXAMPLE </h2>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		
		var x = 10;
		var y = 12;

		var z = x + y;

		document.write(z);

	</script>
